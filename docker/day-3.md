# Docker volumes
Containers are ephemeral, meaning they don‚Äôt persist data after termination or restart. To preserve data beyond the container lifecycle, we use volumes.
1. Named Volumes  
   - Created and managed by Docker.  
   - Persist beyond container removal.  
   - Used for sharing data between containers.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     docker volume create myvolume
     docker run -v myvolume:/data ubuntu
     ```  

2. Anonymous Volumes  
   - Temporary volumes without a name.  
   - Exist only as long as the container runs.  
   - Deleted when the container is removed.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     docker run -v /data ubuntu
     ```  

3. Bind Mounts  
   - Mounts a host file/folder into the container.  
   - Can expose host data to containers.  
   - Best practice is to use read-only mode to prevent security risks.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     docker run -v /host/path:/container/path:ro ubuntu
     ```  
   - `ro` (read-only) ensures the container cannot modify host files.  
   - If `rw` (read-write) is used, a vulnerable container can get full control over the host filesystem.

| Read file      | ‚úÖ Yes                    | ‚úÖ Yes                   |
| Modify file    | ‚úÖ Yes                    | ‚ùå No                    |
| Delete file    | ‚úÖ Yes                    | ‚ùå No                    |

|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Anonymous Volume   | `-v /data`             | ‚ùå Removed with container      | Temporary storage       |
| Named Volume       | `-v myvolume:/data`    | ‚úÖ Survives container removal  | Persistent data         |
| Bind Mount        | `-v /host/path:/data`  | ‚úÖ Exists on host             | Direct file access      |


# Docker-Compose
Docker Compose is a tool that helps you define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file (docker-compose.yml). Instead of running multiple docker run commands manually, you can define your entire application stack in one file and start everything with a single command.

Why Use Docker Compose?
1. Easier management ‚Äì Define all services (databases, backend, frontend, etc.) in one place.
2. Automatic networking ‚Äì All services in a Compose file are in the same network by default.
3. Simplified commands ‚Äì Instead of multiple docker run commands, just use docker-compose up.
4. Scalability ‚Äì Easily scale services (docker-compose up --scale backend=3).
5. Environment configuration ‚Äì Use .env files for variables.

Basic Example (docker-compose.yml):
```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  backend:
    image: my-backend-image
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    networks:
      - app_network

  database:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
    networks:
      - app_network

networks:
  app_network:
```
This defines:
- A backend service running on port 5000.
- A MySQL database with credentials.
- A custom network app_network connecting both services.

How to Use Docker Compose:
1. Start services  
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
2. View running containers  
   ```sh
   docker-compose ps
   ```
3. Stop services  
   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```
### Key Commands  
- `docker-compose up -d` ‚Üí Start all services in detached mode.  
- `docker-compose down` ‚Üí Stop and remove containers.  
- `docker-compose ps` ‚Üí List running services.  
- `docker-compose logs` ‚Üí View logs.  
- `docker-compose exec app sh` ‚Üí Access a running container.  

### Use Cases  
- Running **microservices**  
- **Local development** environments  
- Defining **test setups** with databases, message brokers, etc.

# docker best practices
- Official image
- Multi stage docker build to keep image size less
- Avoid containers run as root user
- Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files.
- Combine multiple RUN instructions to reduce image layers.
- Use specific image versions instead of latest.
- Regularly update images to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Clean up unused images, containers, and volumes to free up space.
- Use environment variables for configuration instead of hardcoding.
- Prefer CMD over ENTRYPOINT unless strict execution control is needed.
