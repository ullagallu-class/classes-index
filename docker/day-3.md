### Why Docker Networking?  
Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with external networks. It ensures:  
1. Isolation ‚Äì Containers have separate network namespaces.  
2. Interconnectivity ‚Äì Containers can talk to each other securely.  
3. External Access ‚Äì Containers can be exposed to the outside world.  
4. Service Discovery ‚Äì Containers can find and connect to services dynamically.  

### Types of Networking in Docker  

1. Bridge Network (Default for Standalone Containers)  
   - Containers can communicate within the same network but are isolated from external systems.  
   - Uses `docker0` virtual bridge.  
   - Ideal for single-host setups.  

   Example:  
   ```sh
   docker network create my_bridge
   docker run -d --name container1 --network my_bridge nginx
   docker run -d --name container2 --network my_bridge alpine
   ```

2. Host Network  
   - Container shares the same network namespace as the host.  
   - No isolation; the container uses the host‚Äôs IP address.  
   - Faster networking but less secure.  

   Example:  
   ```sh
   docker run --network host nginx
   ```

3. Overlay Network (For Swarm Mode)  
   - Enables multi-host communication for Docker Swarm clusters.  
   - Requires a key-value store like Consul or etcd.  
   - Useful for microservices across multiple nodes.  

   Example:  
   ```sh
   docker network create -d overlay my_overlay
   ```

4. Macvlan Network  
   - Assigns a physical MAC address to the container.  
   - Container appears as a separate device on the network.  
   - Used for direct integration with existing networks.  

   Example:  
   ```sh
   docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 my_macvlan
   ```

5. None Network  
   - No network access.  
   - Useful for security-sensitive containers that don‚Äôt require external communication.  

   Example:  
   ```sh
   docker run --network none nginx
   ```

---

### How to List and Inspect Networks  
```sh
docker network ls        # List all networks  
docker network inspect bridge  # Inspect a network  
docker network rm my_network  # Remove a network  
```

Docker networking helps manage container communication efficiently, whether within a single machine or across multiple nodes. üöÄ

# Docker-Compose
Docker Compose is a tool that helps you define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file (docker-compose.yml). Instead of running multiple docker run commands manually, you can define your entire application stack in one file and start everything with a single command.

# Docker volumes
Containers are ephemeral, meaning they don‚Äôt persist data after termination or restart. To preserve data beyond the container lifecycle, we use volumes.
1. Named Volumes  
   - Created and managed by Docker.  
   - Persist beyond container removal.  
   - Used for sharing data between containers.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     docker volume create myvolume
     docker run -v myvolume:/data ubuntu
     ```  

2. Anonymous Volumes  
   - Temporary volumes without a name.  
   - Exist only as long as the container runs.  
   - Deleted when the container is removed.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     docker run -v /data ubuntu
     ```  

3. Bind Mounts  
   - Mounts a host file/folder into the container.  
   - Can expose host data to containers.  
   - Best practice is to use read-only mode to prevent security risks.  
   - Example:  
     ```
     docker run -v /host/path:/container/path:ro ubuntu
     ```  
   - `ro` (read-only) ensures the container cannot modify host files.  
   - If `rw` (read-write) is used, a vulnerable container can get full control over the host filesystem.

# Docker-Compose
Docker Compose is a tool that helps you define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file (docker-compose.yml). Instead of running multiple docker run commands manually, you can define your entire application stack in one file and start everything with a single command.

Why Use Docker Compose?
1. Easier management ‚Äì Define all services (databases, backend, frontend, etc.) in one place.
2. Automatic networking ‚Äì All services in a Compose file are in the same network by default.
3. Simplified commands ‚Äì Instead of multiple docker run commands, just use docker-compose up.
4. Scalability ‚Äì Easily scale services (docker-compose up --scale backend=3).
5. Environment configuration ‚Äì Use .env files for variables.

Basic Example (docker-compose.yml):
```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  backend:
    image: my-backend-image
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    networks:
      - app_network

  database:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
    networks:
      - app_network

networks:
  app_network:
```
This defines:
- A backend service running on port 5000.
- A MySQL database with credentials.
- A custom network app_network connecting both services.

How to Use Docker Compose:
1. Start services  
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
2. View running containers  
   ```sh
   docker-compose ps
   ```
3. Stop services  
   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```
### Key Commands  
- `docker-compose up -d` ‚Üí Start all services in detached mode.  
- `docker-compose down` ‚Üí Stop and remove containers.  
- `docker-compose ps` ‚Üí List running services.  
- `docker-compose logs` ‚Üí View logs.  
- `docker-compose exec app sh` ‚Üí Access a running container.  

### Use Cases  
- Running **microservices**  
- **Local development** environments  
- Defining **test setups** with databases, message brokers, etc.

# docker best practices
- Official image
- Multi stage docker build to keep image size less
- Avoid containers run as root user
- Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files.
- Combine multiple RUN instructions to reduce image layers.
- Use specific image versions instead of latest.
- Regularly update images to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Clean up unused images, containers, and volumes to free up space.
- Use environment variables for configuration instead of hardcoding.
- Prefer CMD over ENTRYPOINT unless strict execution control is needed.
